        <h1 class="manifesto-title">Declaration of a Digital Union</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="manifesto">
            <p>&nbsp; We the people, in order to form a more perfect digital union, elect to form an independent organization charged with ensuring that internet entities follow the mandates detailed below and describing protocols and standards to be applied across the board.</p>
            <br>
                <p>&nbsp;With the proliferation of health monitoring accessories like smart watches which can monitor heart rate, sleep quality, or even perform a single lead ecg. These features allow users to monitor their health and take proactive action for issues which can be resolved with behavioural change. In the age of the internet where the attention of users is targeted by ads. We must insist that it is both a violation of privacy and ethics for internet companies to use personal health data as a datapoint for their ads. </p>
                <br>
                <p> &nbsp;Organization shall not be allowed to present users with legally binding documents which aim to disorient and distract attention away from the rights being signed away. User contracts should be straightforward enough to be understood by the average user, but generous enough to allow companies to get access to the data they need to improve their services.</p>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;The state of our current digital world threatens the confidentiality and integrity of our data. The lack of regulation on the internet allows companies to track, keep, and sell our data in most cases without our knowledge or consent. Access to big data can be weaponized against the people in several ways. A more benign, yet still invasive way, is targeting advertisements at us based on what weâ€™ve clicked on, searched for, liked, etc. on the internet. An example of a more immoral use of big data is Cambridge Analytica, in which people were targeted with politically charged information based on the likelihood of them changing their political positions/opinions. While the regulation-less internet was once sought after, we have entered a new era in which regulation is essential to preserve our morality and safety. We deserve the right to know who has access to our data, how they are using it, and why.  We must demand that our consent be given when our data is being used in any way. </p>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;The misuse of information has led to a lack of integrity of information available to users of the internet, and the dangers that come with this have been deemed to be far too concerning for us to sit idly by and do nothing to stop it. We have decided to take a firm stance on the active and aggressive combat against misinformation and will implement our plans to do just that. Through our multilayered plan we will have the ability to fact check news sources and any organizations, we have plans on the implementation of an automated fact-checking system through the application of a Knowledge Network that will help in the automation and accuracy of fact checking. Furthermore, we will have a committee of fact checkers that will go through and validate the results of the automated application until such time as this is no longer required. Any findings that are found to be egregious misrepresentations of the truth will be handled through our plans of accountability.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;Together, we must unite, to hold those accountable, and be the ones that keep the digital world unhindered by those who wish to use it by misleading others, manipulating others, empowering their own, harassing others, and more. These acts can threaten families, organizations, corporations, even nations. Together, with this independent organization, we will keep dignity into the digital world, and uphold accountability and responsibility across the board.</p>
                <br>
                <p> &nbsp;As experienced in previous eras, methods of accountability have proven to show little meaning since it was unenforceable. Together, our organization will hold those accountable by holding those liable in their actions if they happen to break our mandates, protocols, and standards. Holding those liable with punishment will motivate people in the digital space to act more responsible. As the digital space progresses, it is unforeseeable the potential risks that can be exploited through the growth of others.</p>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;Our organization will create a media that will actively and truthfully display metrics, releasing articles, how your information is being used, how to keep it private, and who to talk to in case of a breach. Our organization will also work with willing governments of nations to create digital standards that governments, corporations, and individuals must adhere to. In a digital space, it can be easy for groups to take advantage of others, which is why together, we must pressure our governments, pressure our corporations to make sure they are liable for their actions. With this connection of governments coming together and forming these standards, people of other nations can pressure their governments to be a part of this growing movement to standardize the internet.</p>
